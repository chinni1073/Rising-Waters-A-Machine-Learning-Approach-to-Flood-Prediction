   Abstract

Floods are among the most severe natural disasters that result in extensive economic losses and threaten human life. Early prediction of flood events can significantly reduce these risks by enabling timely preventive actions. This project presents an AI-based flood prediction system that utilizes historical rainfall and climatic data to forecast flood occurrences using machine learning techniques. Multiple classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost were implemented and evaluated. The developed model was deployed through a Flask-based web application to provide real-time prediction capability. Experimental results show that ensemble learning methods achieve higher prediction accuracy, making the system suitable for disaster preparedness and early warning applications.

  1. Introduction

Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing significant damage to human lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Accurate and timely flood prediction can greatly reduce these losses by enabling early warning systems and effective disaster management. This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning–based flood prediction system using historical rainfall and climate-related data to predict the likelihood of flood occurrence.

  2. Literature Survey

Several researchers have explored the use of machine learning and statistical approaches for flood prediction. Traditional hydrological models rely heavily on physical simulation methods, which require extensive domain knowledge and large-scale environmental measurements. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks in predicting flood events using historical climate and rainfall datasets. Ensemble learning methods, particularly Random Forest and Gradient Boosting techniques, have shown improved performance due to their ability to capture nonlinear relationships between environmental variables. Based on these findings, this project adopts multiple machine learning classifiers and compares their performance to identify the most accurate predictive model.
